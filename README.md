# RIFM
This repository contains the official code for ACL 2024 paper "Restricted Information Flow Maximization".


## Highlights
This paper introduces a new information-theoretic representation learning framework named RIFM, which aims to extract sufficient representations related to both the input and target task. It ensures that the learned representations have good uniformity and sufficient predictive ability, thereby enhancing the generalization of pre-trained language models for downstream tasks. 

Our experiments were conducted on 10 text classification tasks and 3 regression/prediction tasks, demonstrating that our RIFM can improve the generalization capabilities of pre-trained language models  (including general, data-constrained, and out-of-distribution scenarios), transferability to new tasks, and robustness to attacks.

## News
- The code will be released soon.
